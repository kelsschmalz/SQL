SELECT CustomerId, LastName, FirstName, Country FROM customers WHERE Country != "USA"
ORDER BY LastName asc

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, LastName, FirstName FROM customers WHERE country = "Brazil"
ORDER BY LastName asc

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.customerid, LastName, FirstName, invoiceID, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM customers as c 
LEFT JOIN invoices as i 
ON c.customerid = i.customerid

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT LastName, FirstName FROM employees WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry asc

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees as emp 
JOIN chinook.customers as cust ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices as inv ON inv.customerId=cust.customerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.country, inv.total, emp.LastName, emp.FirstName
FROM customers as cust
JOIN invoices as inv ON inv.customerId=cust.CustomerId
JOIN employees as emp ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices where InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total) FROM invoices where InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.Name,invoice_items.InvoiceLineId FROM
invoice_items
JOIN tracks ON tracks.trackId=invoice_items.TrackID
ORDER BY Name

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.Name as track, artists.name as artist, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId FROM
tracks 
JOIN albums ON albums.albumId=tracks.AlbumId

JOIN artists ON artists.artistId=albums.artistId

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM Employees as emp
JOIN Customers as cust ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeID

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Inv.total), 2) as 'Total Sales' FROM employees as emp
JOIN customers as cust ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices as inv ON inv.CustomerId=Cust.customerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) desc LIMIT 1
