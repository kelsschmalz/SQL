#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#First, I explored the main tables I would be using to understand what data was available: 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers LIMIT  20;

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.jansales LIMIT 20;

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.febsales LIMIT 20;

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.jansales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT  COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.jansales 
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.febsales as feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue FROM BIT_DB.Jansales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price as revenue FROM BIT_DB.Febsales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum) as total_customers, avg(quantity*price) as avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.febsales as feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.Quantity >'2'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID'
