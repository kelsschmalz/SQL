# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL: 

#1. What data is included in this table? 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata LIMIT 3

#2. What are the 10 most popular tracks and who is the artist?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#3. What songs included in the data have less than 3 minutes duration?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, duration_ms FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms < 180000 
ORDER BY duration_ms desc

#4. What is the song name and artist of the loudest song?

SELECT max(loudness), track_name, artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#5. The quietest song? 

SELECT min(loudness), track_name, artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#6. What is the average danceability? 

SELECT avg(danceability) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 

#7. Who is the most popular artist and what is their rank? 

SELECT artist_name, max(popularity) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#8. What is the average duration of song (in minutes)?

SELECT (avg(duration_ms)/1000)/60 as avg_duration_minutes FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#9. What songs include a featured artist? 

SELECT track_name, artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%(WITH%'

#10. Which song is the longest and what is the duration (in minutes)? 

SELECT track_name, artist_name, (max(duration_ms)/1000)/60 as duration_minutes FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#11. How many Top 50 songs did Olivia Rodrigo have in 2021? 

SELECT COUNT(track_name) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
